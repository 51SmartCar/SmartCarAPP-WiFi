Direct Connection\n\nStep 1: Turn on the power switch of Cloud Companion at the bottom of the car, wait about 30 seconds for it to start up and get ready for operation. \nStep 2: Turn on the Wi-Fi on your smart phone or pad.\nStep 3: Select the SSID of Cloud Companion and connect. The general SSID is\ “CC_\”+ 6 figures.\nStep4: Open the CloudCompanion APP, select your Cloud Companion to enter the operational interface. Green icons represent Local Cloud Companion. \n\n2. Router Connection / LAN Connection \n\nIn the router/LAN connection mode, both the Cloud Companion and your devices are connected to a same router. Your smart device connects the Cloud Companion through the router. There are two easy ways to connect your Cloud Companion with the router. \n\nMethod 1: When the Cloud Companion is directly connected to your smart devices, you can easily follow the following steps to connect the Cloud Companion with the router by putting the SSID and password of the router into the Cloud Companion. \n\nStep 1: When smart phone is connected to your Cloud Companion via Wi-Fi, open the APP and click your Cloud Companion’s icon.\nStep 2: Put in the password of your Cloud Companion. Initial password is \”admin\”. Click the purple area to enter the setting page.\nStep 3: Enter the router’s SSID and the Wi-Fi password and click the \“Next\” button. Smart phone will connect to the router Wi-Fi. Then enter the APP, you can find the named Cloud Companion in the local list. Wait for a moment to let the Cloud Companion adapt to the connection. \n\nMethod 2: Easy Configure\n\nStep 1: When smart phone is connected to the router, open the APP, then click the “Add” button.\nStep 2: Select the local Cloud Companion on Add Wizard page. In the Easy Configure mode, smart phone will automatically get the router’s SSID. You only need to name your Cloud Companion and input the router password.\n\nClick the \"Next\" button. Then press the\"Reset\”button at the bottom of the car. The car will easy-configure with your smart phone.\n\nNote: Please make sure to turn on the Cloud Companion for more than 30 seconds and let it boot into the standby state before setting easy-configure. Re-enter the \”choose cloud companion\” page, find the newly added Cloud Companion to control.\n\n3. Cloud Connection / Remote Connection Smart phone is connected to the internet to remote control a Cloud Companion which is connected to the Internet via a router.\n\nAdd a new Cloud Companion\n\nStep 1: Open the APP, click the Add \"+\" button\nStep 2: Enter the Cloud Companion's NABTO ID (e.g., e087b3). You can long-press the icon of your Cloud Companion to copy its NABTO ID and share it for your friend’s remote access.\nStep 3: Back to the front page. You can see the newly added Cloud Companion's ID in the remote Cloud Companion list, click it to start control.\n\nNote: On the \“Choose cloud companion\” page, the green icon represents the local Cloud Companion (including the Cloud Companion in direct connection mode or the LAN mode). The orange icon shows the remote Cloud Companion. When a smart phone or a Pad is connected to the internet, it can access the Cloud Companion that is connected to the Internet via the router. \n\nInstruction of the \“Reset\” button at the bottom of the car \nTo reset the vehicle to default setting, long press the “Reset” button with something sharp for 10 seconds. That is mainly used for relieving the pairing state between the Cloud Companion and the router. You can short press the RESET button for 1 second to easy configure them.\n\nNote: You must put in the password of Cloud Companion before entering the operational interface.\n\n(Note: It is recommended to choose the router connection mode when you are in a place with Wi-Fi. Cloud Companion's control range in this mode is wider than that in the direct connection. If the APP software can not activate your car, please check whether the power switch is on or the Cloud Companion is connected to the Wi-Fi.
