 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Nabto Client API 
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The Nabto client API exposes Nabto functionality that enables you to
 * access any Nabto enabled device on the Internet. You incorporate the
 * Nabto client API in your own Nabto client applications or your own
 * plug-ins for other client software such as web browsers.
 *
 * The Nabto client API is divided into five major parts.
 *
 *  1.   Configuration and initialization API.
 *  2.   The session API.
 *  3.   The streaming API.
 *  4.   The tunnel API.
 *  5.   The portal API.
 *
 *  The configuration and initialization API is typically the first you
 *  will use. Here you can modify the behavior of the client API. For
 *  instance, change the location of the log file, change language of the
 *  html code returned by the session API, etc. You must also call
 *  nabtoStartup first to enable most of the functions in the other APIs to
 *  work properly.
 *
 *  The session API is a set of functions that enables you to make
 *  synchronous and asynchronous request to any Nabto enabled device
 *  (assuming you have the right credentials).
 *
 *  The streaming API is a set of functions that enables you to make a
 *  permanent connection to a Nabto enabled device (assuming you have the
 *  right credentials). You will be able to read and write data from and to
 *  the device through the connection (Nabto stream).
 *
 *  The tunnel API is a set of functions that enables you to make a TCP
 *  connection to a remote server through a Nabto enabled device. You can
 *  use a standard TCP/IP socket to read and write data from and to the
 *  remote server.
 *
 *  The portal API is a set of functions that enables you to manage
 *  accounts and passwords on the Nabto portal.
